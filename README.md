# AoC-1-12-2017
Solution for the first day of AoC 2017 using android java, both parts, which you can toggle with the toggle button labeled "PART1".

# Test-case functionality (Run Custom)
You can use any numerical value. Type it into the input-box and then press "Run Custom"

# Test using the actual input provided by AoC
Press "Run Result". I thought it would slightly annoying to type all the 2052 numbers on a cellphone :)
